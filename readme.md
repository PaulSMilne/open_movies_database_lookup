The plan is to create a "defense of edinburgh" game, with goats defending the borders of Edinburgh against maurading pokemon.

Basically there will be n goats inside the city boundary. As a pokemon reaches the boundary the goat will bash into it, eliminating it from the game.

If any pokemon get inside the boundary, the pokemon win. If none get inside, the goats win.

I will need:

* Objects:
 * mapping data from OpenStreetMap and a way to render it in a canvas object
 * a goat sprite to replicated inside the city boundaries
 * a variety of pokemon sprites with different speed attributes
* Behaviours:
 * move pokemon along paths defined by major roads into Edinburgh
 * move goats in any direction to intercept a pokemon
 * goats move to nearest pokemon but only if there is no other goat intercepting
 * when win is triggered an appropriate animated gif is played, either a random one from the giphy file of random goat gifs, or a celebratory pokemon one.
